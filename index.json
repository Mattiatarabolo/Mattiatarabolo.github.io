The method is developed within a fully Bayesian framework and accounts for non-causal effects generated by the presence of observations. It is based on a graphical model representation of the epidemic stochastic process and utilizes dynamic cavity equations to derive a set of self-consistent equations for probability marginals defined on the edges of the contact graph. By performing a small-coupling expansion, a pair of time-dependent cavity messages is obtained, which capture the probability of individual infection and the conditioning power of observations. In its efficient formulation, the computational cost per iteration of the SCDC algorithm is linear in the duration of the epidemic dynamics and in the number of contacts. The SCDC method is derived for the Susceptible-Infected (SI) model and straightforwardly applicable to other Markovian epidemic processes, including recurrent ones. It exhibits high accuracy in assessing individual risk on par with Belief Propagation techniques and outperforming heuristic methods based on individual-based mean-field approximations. Although convergence issues may arise due to long-range correlations in contact graphs, the estimated marginal probabilities remain sufficiently accurate for reliable risk estimation. Future work includes extending the method to non-Markovian recurrent epidemic models and investigating the role of second-order terms in the small coupling expansion of the observation-reweighted Dynamic Cavity equations.","tags":["Condensed Matter - Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter - Statistical Mechanics","Physics - Data Analysis","Statistics and Probability","Quantitative Biology - Populations and Evolution"],"title":"Small-Coupling Dynamic Cavity: a Bayesian mean-field framework for epidemic inference","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"We developed a novel generalized mean field approximation, called the Small-Coupling Dynamic Cavity (SCDC) method, for Bayesian epidemic inference and risk assessment.

Various environment-dependent phylogenetic comparative methods, that allow testing whether and how past. These methods build upon classical birth-death models of cladogenesis used to study speciation and extinction dynamics from phylogenies of extant species, where the evolutionary rates correspond to speciation and extinction rates. Even though several recent studies have fitted these models to comparative phylogenetic data, providing estimates of the association between evolutionary rates and environmental variables, the phylogenetic methods already developed have several limitations. The most limiting factor is that they were implemented in a maximum likelihood rather than a bayesian framework, which precludes the development of more complex models. In particular, the maximum likelihood approach allows to test only the effect of one environmental variable at a time, due to the problem of overparametrization. environmental changes influenced evolutionary rates have recently been developed. We propose to overcome this problem using a Bayesian implementation, and we will show how this approach actually outperform the Maximum likelihood implementation even when using a single environmental dependency. Implementing these models in a Bayesian framework allow to use Bayesian Variable selection techniques, which overcome the problem of overparametrization through the use of informative priors. We will present in details the method, and we will propose a simple implementation through Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling.","tags":[],"title":"Bayesian variable selection for environment-dependent phylogenetic models of diversification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mattia Tarabolo"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1601510400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1683627947,"objectID":"ad7aa9361016790929065f32ec7ad08a","permalink":"https://Mattiatarabolo.github.io/publication/tarabolo-estrazione-2020/","publishdate":"2023-05-09T10:25:47.275789Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tarabolo-estrazione-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Estrazione di numeri primi da un flusso di bit casuali","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"fd36605688ef45e10dc233c860158012","permalink":"https://Mattiatarabolo.github.io/cv/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/cv/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"CV","type":"landing"}]
